        <h2>Typographic variants</h2>
        <p class="body-text">During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.[6]</p>

        <h2>Text Version of the Gasoline Label</h2>
        <p class="body-text">This label was created at the time of the rulemaking. The assumptions and ratings do not reflect a particular model year.
            1. Vehicle Technology & Fuel
            
            The upper right corner of the label displays text and a related icon to identify it as a gasoline vehicle.
            You will see different text and icons on the labels for other vehicles. Note that hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles that do not have plug-in capability are identified as gasoline vehicles since they only use gasoline.
            
            2.  Fuel Economy
            
            For gasoline vehicles, the label shows City, Highway, and Combined MPG (miles per gallon) values. The Combined MPG value is the most prominent for the purpose of quick and easy comparison across vehicles. Combined fuel economy is a weighted average of City and Highway MPG values that is calculated by weighting the City value by 55% and the Highway value by 45%.
            
            3. Comparing Fuel Economy to Other Vehicles
            
            This text indicates the category of the vehicle (e.g., Small SUV, Station Wagon, Pickup Truck, etc.) and the best and worst fuel economy within that category for the given model year. There are nine car categories, six truck categories, and a “special purpose vehicle” category. This text also tells you the best combined fuel economy among all new vehicles.
            
            For each model year, EPA publishes lists identifying the best and worst fuel economy performers in each category.
            
            Most and Least Efficient Vehicles by EPA Size Class
            
            Note: for those vehicles that do not use liquid fuels--such as electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating on electricity, and compressed natural gas vehicles-- the labels display miles per gallon of gasoline-equivalent (MPGe). Think of this as being similar to MPG, but instead of presenting miles per gallon of the vehicle’s fuel type, it represents the number of miles the vehicle can go using a quantity of fuel with the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline. This allows a reasonable comparison between vehicles using different fuels. For example, you can use MPGe to compare a compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle with a gasoline vehicle, even though CNG is not dispensed or burned in actual gallons. 
            
            4. You Save/Spend More over 5 Years Compared to Average Vehicle
            
            The label shows the estimated fuel cost over a five-year period for the vehicle compared to the average new vehicle. If the vehicle would save the consumer money compared to the average vehicle, the label would state, “You save $x,xxx in fuel costs over 5 years compared to the average new vehicle.” If the vehicle would be more expensive to operate than the average vehicle, the label would state, “You spend $x,xxx more in fuel costs over 5 years compared to the average new vehicle.” These estimates are based on driving 15,000 miles per year, for five years, and the projected fuel price for the year, which changes annually, and is referenced in the fine print.
            
            5. Fuel Consumption Rate
            
            While a miles per gallon (MPG) estimate is a required feature that has appeared on the fuel economy label for several decades, this metric can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements, particularly when they use it in place of fuel costs. The following chart shows the non-linear relationship between gallons used over a given distance and miles per gallon. The fuel savings, in gallons, for a vehicle that gets 10 MPG versus a vehicle that gets 15 MPG is about 33 gallons (assuming 1000 miles). On the other hand, the fuel savings in gallons, for the same 5 MPG fuel economy jump, for a 30 MPG versus a 35 MPG vehicle is only about 5 gallons.</p>
